Hi Guys, 
by this project i created the Movie Searching APP using OMDB API to fetch the data for our app. 
Front-End-Technologies used - HTML+ TailWind CSS + REACT JS + React-router + React-hot-hoast (to display the dailogue box (error message)) + React+Icons.
to develop the project, i used the react concept like react hooks (UseState, UseEffect, UsedeBouncedCallBack, useContext) , and functions like Async and Await . to fetch the data from API i used the Axios instead of fetch. 
finally for styling i used 3dcard.tsx for dancing card when cursor is on the pointer card, responsive CSS for using on the various screen size and drak and light theme is created for feel good user experience
